BlackEye CMS
============
The best DarkOrbit private server.
Current version: 1.0.

CMS Structure
-------------
The core of the CMS (the installation of Alexya) is located in the directory *alexya* while the directory *public_html* contains the files interpreted by the browser (css, images, js...).

The CMS is build on top of the [Alexya Framework](https://github.com/AlexyaFramework/Alexya) so you should check it for knowing how it works.
There just two pages (they're located on *Application/Page*):
 * Internal page
 * External page

The external page simply prints external page and registers/logins users.
The internal page will load the requested module (they're located on *Application/Module*) and render it.

Before continue you should go to the *alexya* directory and execute `composer update` for installing composer's dependencies.

ORM Classes
-----------
The ORM classes are under the *\Application\ORM* package and are used to translate the database tables to objects.

Between all the ORM classes, the  class *\Application\ORM\Account* is the most important since it's used everywhere. This class represents the user that is currently visitting the website so take a close look to it.

SocksWork
---------
*SocksWork* is the way the CMS will be linked to the emulator for keeping it updated about the things user does on the website (like bidding on auction, buying items...).

The *SocksWork* object is instanced in *index.php* and takes the configuration values from *config/alexya.php*, by default the client connects to *127.0.0.1:1207*.

The packets *SocksWork* sends are located in *Application/Packets* and their structure is on the documentation of each packet.

Localization
------------
When printing texts always use the *\Alexya\Locale\Localization::translate* function (*t* is a shortcut for the function) so the text can be translated whenever it's possible. Also use the functions *\Alexya\Locale\Localization::formatNumber* (*fNumber* as shortcut) and *\Alexya\Locale\Localization::formatDate* (*fDate* as shortcut) for formatting numbers and dates.
